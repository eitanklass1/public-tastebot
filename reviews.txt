I was pleasantly surprised by what Steam has to offer in terms of dim sum and other pan Chinese dishes. The atmosphere is very chic, open, and clean. They serve jasmine tea by default, but you can also ask the server to provide tea based on preference, such as oolong, green tea, chrysanthemum, or pu'er tea. Any of the "classic" dim sum dishes will be a good choice for your visit: -Sticky rice wrapped in bamboo leaf. Steamed perfectly with lots of great fillings, including pork, egg, and sausage. -Shrimp dumpling (Ha Gau). Tried and true, with excellent shrimp portions. Try it with a little soy sauce or a some hot sauce -Pork dumpling (Siu Mai). Great job on a classic. They add a little roe on top too! The lunch and dinner items are also excellent. Don't miss the Singaporean rice noodles! Finally, you can decide on tipping. They add a 15% service charge on top. The service is excellent!
