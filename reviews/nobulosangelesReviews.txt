Did not intend on valeting due to the mediocre valet reviews and was able to find a metered spot directly across from the restaurant, which was great. Ambiance is great, inside is dimly lit and quite romantic. Service was good and our waiter was pretty attentive, knowledgeable, and personable. We ordered 14 dishes, a wine, and a drink. Notable dishes included the yellowtail jalapeno, which was well-liked amongst those who could eat seafood, the crab and wagyu tacos, which was a bit on the small side but tasty, the soft-shell crab roll, which was one person's favorite, and the black cod with miso, which was expensive but pretty worth it as a standout dish. Honorable mentions for the squid pasta, which was better than expected, and the tamago, which was fun because it was Nobu-branded but only had a tiny bit of rice.
I think the sushi restaurant offered a lot of quality options for a decent price. My highlight of the night would have to be the Japanese whisky, Mars Iwai Tradition, Northern Japan, Blended. I ordered the whisky on the rocks and when it came out, it tasted nothing like I had before. The way they serve it to you, you can taste all the complex notes and smell all the subtle aromas normally not experienced elsewhere. It also had no alcohol burn whatsoever. I tried getting a similar bottle of Japanese whisky after, but it wasn't as good. I will definitely return for glass of their whisky.
To start, we had the crispy okra, which was very delicious with the ponzu sauce. The perfect blackened crisp was most desirable. Next came the nigiri, the baked snow crab cut roll, and the house special roll. I wasn't a big fan of the house special cut. In fact, I didn't like it at all, but the other items really make up for it. The toro would have to be my favorite, with its fresh, full and satisfying texture. The wagyu was also really good, but had a tad wilder flavor. Shima aji (jack) and the hotate (scallop) were both really fresh and good. If I had to pick my top two faves, it would be the toro and the hotate.
The black miso cod was very sweet, soft and buttery in texture throughout. We both felt this was the better dish of the night. The king crab tempura amazu ponzu had ingredients the speaks for itself. The only challenge with this dish is it came submerged in the sauce, so the tempura lost its crispy texture on arrival. Aside from that, you can tell the crab meat itself was top quality and extremely fresh.
Our server described the food here as a blend between Japanese and Peruvian fusion. While refreshing at first, halfway through the meal the very zesty and saltiness of some of the dishes really got to us. It was def an experience of interesting flavors, miniature foods and novel sushi combos. I recommend doing your research on the menu before going. The food here is obviously overpriced, and some items can really miss the mark. However the few good ones, are memorably unique and saves an evening of overwise, very mid food.
Service - After ordering, service noticeably declined. We went on a Saturday night but it wasn't particularly packed. I suspect it to be because we *respectfully declined* our server's recs (she was very clearly trying to push certain items). Anyways, most of the night was spent trying to flag down someone to check on our ice tea refill (our server was just gone or pretended not to see us who knows). She did come back at the end of the night to give us our bill, but promptly walked away after we signed. No thanks for dining here, literally just Bye Felicia. Her aside, the other servers were quite friendly, prompt, and explained each dish that came out in detail.
Yellowtail Jalapeno was 3/5 because it was Zesty, wish the fish was more chilled. The cilantro went well with the jalapeno.
Lobster Taco was a 5/5 because This was an explosion of flavor in the best way. The taco shell was airy and crispy, the flavor of the filling was zesty and well balanced.
Wagyu Taco was a 2/5 because We found this too gamey. Came with a cilantro lime sauce but the gaminess of the beef overpowered the sauce.
Oysters was 3/5 because it comes with 3 oysters. Someone went too ham squeezing the limes here, the oysters came in a sea of lime juice that overpowered the oyster. There was also a green apricot/plum(?) fruit that was garnishing. That fruit was legit the most delicious thing all evening. It was sweet and had a refreshing, crunchy texture.
Scallops in Red Sauce was 2/5 because it was 3 cooked scallops in a vegetable medley of asparagus and shiitake mushrooms w a chili-soy based red colored sauce. The scallops were cooked well and had a nice sweetness to them. If the sauce was on the side or this dish came with rice, it'd be a lot better. The shiitake mushrooms were extremely salty bc the sauce is very salty. I felt incredibly sick midway into this dish from the sauce.
Sushi (comes 2 pieces per order excluding rolls):
1. Toro Scallion cut roll was very refreshing, this was good but nothing out of this world considering Nobu is known for their sushi
2. Salmon sushi was very mid, there was no vinegar taste in the rice and overall very bland
3. Snapper Black Truffle Oil sushi was the most exotic tasting item. This had way too much going on and was a flavor clash in all the worst ways.
4. Mackerel sushi: The kelp in this added a weird sweetness to an otherwise another salty and sour item.
5. Yellowtail sushi was not memorable
Dessert: complimentary dessert is provided for special occasions so make sure to let them know when you make your reservation. We had a chocolate ice cream dessert which was delicious and ended our meal on a good note.
I've seen families here early dinner hours during the week. It is a date or celebration place seems like so weekends may not be kid friendly.
The corkage fee is $30 for wine and $40 for champagne is what I was told.
